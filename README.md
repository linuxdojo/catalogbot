# CatalogBot

CatalogBot is a bidirectional link integration between the [CatalogIt](https://www.catalogit.app/) collection management system and a [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) forum server.

CatalogBot allows CatalogIt users to create "Discuss this item on our forum" weblinks that, when clicked, will redirect the user to a discussion topic for the item, creating the topic if it does not already exist.
